## About Using Dart Code Generator

Doing more with less is key to progress. No one likes repeating the same task over and over again. It is tedious, boring, and not creative at all. Humans are really bad at this. We often make mistakes when doing something repetitive.

As programmers, we don’t like to write boilerplate code or duplicate code, it’s frustrating and boring. With the same capabilities by using Code Generator, we can avoid error prone, time consuming code, and improve scalability.

To generate the code, both package run the same command:

`$ flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
